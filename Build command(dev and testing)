1.Check out the project.
2.Open the terminal within the project directory.
3.Install npm (Node Package Manager).
** If you encounter an error related to "global": "file:global-0.0.4.tgz" in the package.json file, delete the line "global": "file:global-0.0.4.tgz" and then proceed to install the required node modules again.
4.After removing the line, save the changes to the package.json file.
** If the "global": "file:global-0.0.4.tgz" reappears after saving the changes, repeat step 3 (delete the line) and install the node modules once more.
5.Once the node modules are successfully installed, the project is now ready to be built.
6.Use the build command to build the project. The build artifacts will be generated and can be found under the "dist" folder.


Deployment:
1. Start the server.
2.Delete the existing build artifacts.
3.Now, you can deploy the new artifacts by dragging and dropping them into the appropriate location.
